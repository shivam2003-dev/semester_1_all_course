## Overview

- Python-based labs using NumPy, PyTorch, TensorFlow
- Implementations from scratch and with frameworks
- CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, optimization, regularization

## Lab Ideas

- From-scratch MLP with backprop in NumPy
- CNN fine-tuning with PyTorch on a custom dataset
- Transformer text classification via Hugging Face
- Optimizer comparison on a synthetic task
- Regularization experiments: dropout vs weight decay vs label smoothing
