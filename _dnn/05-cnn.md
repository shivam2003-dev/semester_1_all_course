## Overview

- Image data, locality, invariance, channels
- Convolution, padding, stride, pooling
- Feature maps and receptive fields
- LeNet; deep CNNs: AlexNet, VGG, Inception, ResNet
- Transfer learning and fine-tuning

## Dimensions

- Output = (Input − Kernel + 2×Padding)/Stride + 1

## Notes

- Receptive field grows with depth; crucial for context

## Exam Tips

- Compute output sizes for a given CNN stack

## Industry Tips

- Use EfficientNet/MobileNet for edge; ResNet for server
