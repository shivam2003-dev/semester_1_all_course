## Overview

- What deep learning is, why it works, and where it's used
- Supervised learning and motivating real-world examples
- Core components: data, models, loss functions, optimization

## Key Concepts

- Representation learning vs hand-crafted features
- End-to-end differentiable models
- Training pipeline: dataset → model → loss → optimizer → evaluation

## Notes

- Data quality dominates outcomes; deep learning is data-hungry
- Compute matters: GPUs/TPUs enable modern scale; batch size impacts convergence

## Exam Tips

- Contrast classic ML vs deep learning in terms of feature design and scalability
- Explain the roles of loss and optimizer and how they interact

## Industry Tips

- Start with transfer learning for limited data; fine-tune instead of training from scratch
